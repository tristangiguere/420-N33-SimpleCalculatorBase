# 420-N33-SimpleCalculatorBase

Project created by <strong>Donglin Pang and Tristan Gigu√®re.</strong>

<strong>The function added:</strong> We added the exponent function, also reffered to as powered. It allows you to calculate anu number to a power, using the Math.Pow method.

<strong>To enhance the program:</strong> Added an input validation, which welcomes the user, and then asks him is he READY TO CALCULATE! If he accepts, the program runs, and if he doesn't, the program clears the console screen and tells him a goodbye message.
